Introduction

Bug bounty is a program where companies invite security researchers to find security flaws in their software and reward them for valid reports. It’s legal and ethical when you follow the program rules (scope, engagement rules). Bug bounty hunting is a practical way to learn real-world security and can be financially rewarding.

What is a Bug Bounty Program?

A Bug Bounty Program is an agreement between a company and security researchers where the company offers rewards (money, recognition) for responsibly reported security vulnerabilities in their systems.

Definitions

Bug: A mistake or error in code that can cause unexpected behavior.

Security Vulnerability: A weakness that an attacker could exploit to steal data, take over a system, or cause harm.

White Hat / Ethical Hacker: A security researcher who tests systems legally and reports issues responsibly.

Scope: The list of assets (domains, apps, APIs) you are allowed to test.

Out-of-scope: Assets or actions explicitly forbidden (testing these can cause legal trouble).

Why Companies Offer Bounties

More Eyes, More Security: Crowdsource testing — many independent researchers find more issues than a small internal team.

Pay for Results: Companies pay when a real issue is found; no payment for time that doesn't yield value.

Fix Before Attack: Find and fix vulnerabilities before criminals exploit them.

The Bug Bounty Process (Step-by-Step)
Step 1 — Program Definition (The Rules)

A program usually defines:

Scope: Allowed targets (domains, IPs, endpoints, mobile apps).

Out-of-scope: What you must NOT test.

Rules of engagement: What testing methods are allowed/disallowed (e.g., no destructive testing, limits on automated scans).

Reward structure: How much is paid for different severities.

Important: Always read and follow the program’s rules before testing.

Step 2 — Hacking (Ethically!)

Test only assets inside scope.

Use knowledge, tools, manual testing, and think like an attacker.

If you find sensitive data or a way to access other users’ accounts, stop and report — do not exploit further.

Step 3 — Reporting the Bug

A clear, high-quality report speeds up triage and payment. A good report contains:

Title (short summary)

Vulnerability details and impact

Clear, numbered steps to reproduce (PoC)

Screenshots, logs, or small proof-of-concept (PoC) code

Any remediation suggestions (optional)

Step 4 — Verification and Reward

The company performs triage and attempts to reproduce.

If validated and new, they assign severity (low → critical).

They decide bounty amount (based on severity & program rules), then pay and schedule a fix.

Common Vulnerability Types (Short List)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting code that runs in another user’s browser.

SQL Injection (SQLi): Manipulating database queries to read/modify data.

Broken Authentication: Problems that allow unauthorized access to accounts.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Forcing a logged-in user to perform actions without consent.

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): Accessing data for other users by changing identifiers.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Making the server request internal or external resources it shouldn’t.

How to Get Started (Learning Path)
1. Learn the Basics

HTTP: Methods (GET, POST), status codes, headers, cookies, sessions.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Understand how web pages are built and where inputs exist.

Databases & SQL: Basic queries and how user input can affect them.

Linux & CLI: Many tools are command-line based.

2. Study Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

Start with the OWASP Top 10 list to learn common web risks and examples.

For each vulnerability type, learn:

What it is (simple definition)

Why it happens (root cause)

How to find it (testing techniques)

How to fix it (remediation)

3. Practice Safely (Labs & CTFs)

Use intentionally vulnerable apps and lab platforms (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop, WebGoat, CTF platforms).

PortSwigger Web Security Academy is an excellent free resource (interactive labs).

NEVER test live sites that are not explicitly in scope.

4. Choose Your First Program

Start with programs that:

Have a friendly scope for beginners

Offer VDPs (vulnerability disclosure programs) where competition might be lower

Provide clear rules and triage timelines

5. Read Other Reports

Study public disclosure reports and write-ups on bug bounty platforms to learn what kinds of reports get paid and why.

Responsible Disclosure — Legal & Ethical Rules

Only test in-scope assets.

Respect the program’s engagement rules.

Do not access or publish sensitive user data.

Stop testing as soon as you find and can reproduce a vulnerability; report it.

Do not exploit issues beyond proof-of-concept.

Follow coordinated disclosure: give the vendor time to fix before public disclosure (if allowed by program).

Failing to follow these can lead to legal consequences.
